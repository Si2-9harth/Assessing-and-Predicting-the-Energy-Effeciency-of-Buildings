# Assessing and Predicting the Energy Effeciency of Buildings
Deep Learning approaches using Artificial Neural Network to be applied in forecasting and improving building energy performance.
## List of features for prediction of the Heating and Cooling load were based on.
1. Relative Compactness
2. Surface Area
3. Wall Area
4. Roof Area
5. Overall Height
6. Orientation
7. Glazing Area
8. Glazing Area Distribution
